project-1 for Unit 1: Creating the Card game war

# How to play WAR!:
The deck is split evenly between two players.

Each player flips the top card of their pile.

The higher card wins, and that player takes both cards and puts them on the bottom of their pile.

If the cards are equal, it’s a “war”: each player places 2  cards face down, then another face-up card. The higher face-up card wins all the cards.

The game keeps going until one player has all the cards (they win).
