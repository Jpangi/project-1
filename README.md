**WAR** is a digital version of the classic card game ‚ÄúWar,‚Äù built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

In War, two players (you vs. computer) split a deck of cards in half. The two players each get one half of the deck to draw from. The players then draw cards from the top of the deck. The player with the higher card wins the round and collects both cards. If there‚Äôs a tie, a "tie" is triggered where each player loses both cards drawn. The game continues until one player runs out of cards.

I chose this project because ‚ÄúWar‚Äù is a game i used to play a lot with my grandparents and brother growing up. So it hold special meaning to me.
